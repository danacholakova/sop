How can I thank you? Your heart is so huge! You keep everything I ever share with you in there like your life depended on it. How can you be so kind and so open to everyone sharing everything with you? Maybe if you werenâ€™t so popular we could have worked out, but Git has my heart now. I still wanted to thank you for everything you do for me, but it will never work between us. 

<br/> 

<h1> Sorry GitHub but you are just a really good friend to me and I would never want to ruin our friendship. </h1>

<br/>

<span class="sincerely"> Sincerely, </span>
<br/> <span class="me"> Your bestie Dana </span>
